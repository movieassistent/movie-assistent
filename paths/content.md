    4.	Project management using a database fully GDPR compliant
    5.	Tab navigation to different routes

    7.	User permissions:

            SUPERADMIN (Company-Side):
            Access to all projects
            Can create/delete/rename/publish/unpublish/approve projects upon request

##Key points to implement:

    1.	Idea deployment - Trello like
    2.	Project Calendar - Consolidate all events, plans, and off-periods across your production to a single calendar for your entire team to see.
    3.	Production Calendar - Get a clear picture of the entirety of production – from prep to shoot to post, all on the Gantt Chart.
    4.	Cast and Crew - one-stop hub for everyone: bring teams together, collaborate and share information across the board.
    5.	Script Import & Breakdowns - Get a script breakdown running by simply importing screenplays from Final Draft, PDF, and more. Version by version.
    6.	Shooting Schedule & Day Out Of Days (DOODs) - Import existing schedules or assemble a stripboard by dragging and dropping scenes – and generate your Day-Out-Of-Days reports in real-time!
    7.	Call Sheets - Create or reuse templates and let us fill in all the details. Edit and customize the sheet to your liking, then send and track to a mobile app.
    8.	Announcements - Use a cast or crew mailing list to keep everyone (or a select few) updated!
    9.	File Sharing - Keep all users in the loop – or share the latest files with talents and external partners directly from within the app.
    10.	Comments - Resolve issues on the fly in a structured way.
    11.	Watermarking - Automate sending scripts, videos, and files to the cast and crew – all with a custom watermark!
    12.	Tracking - Keep track of who has viewed, edited, uploaded, downloaded, received, lost, or commented at any given moment.
    13.	Advanced Permissions - Control who has access to what according to their position. Keep sensitive data on the cast and crew under wraps.
